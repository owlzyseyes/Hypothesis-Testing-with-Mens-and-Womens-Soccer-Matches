# Hypothesis-Testing-with-Mens-and-Womens-Soccer-Matches
 Determining the answer to the question: Are more goals scored in women's international soccer matches than men's?

I have assumed a 10% significance level, and used the following null and alternative hypotheses:

Null Hypothesis: The mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is the same as men's.

Alternative Hypothesis: The mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is greater than men's.
